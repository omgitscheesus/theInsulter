You stink like old cheese. One which farted.
Your mother kicks children from their bicycle and smells the saddle.
Your mom works on a fishing boat. Shes the smell.
If you catch fire, i wont even piss on you.
What a like about you? You will die one day.
If you were a good person, you killed yourself.
